# minish
### An ultra-minimal shell with pipes

## Download
```
git clone https://github.com/breakthatbass/minish.git
```

## Build
```
make
```

## Run
```
cd dist
./minish
```

## Exit Minish
```
exit
```

make tests
```

## Usage
You use it like any other Unix shell. However, unlike most toy/project Unix shells, with `minish` you can use multiple pipes. 

## ToDo

1. make all tests pass and fix all memory leaks
2. add arrow key usage
3. add history
