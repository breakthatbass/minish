# minish
### An ultra-minimal shell with pipes
***a work in progress***

## Download
```
git clone https://github.com/breakthatbass/minish.git
```

## Run
```
cd minish
make
./minish
```

## Exit Minish
```
exit
```

## Usage
You use it like any other Unix shell. However, unlike most toy/project Unix shells, with `minish` you can use multiple pipes. 

## ToDo

1. add redirection (there is currently limited redirection...)
2. change exit function to read all zombie processes
3. add arrow key usage
4. add history
